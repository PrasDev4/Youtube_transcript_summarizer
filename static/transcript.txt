once upon a time there was a small village called nalim in the hill region of shivapuram the entire area belonged to a landlord family for generations and The Villages were simple folk the landlord was also quite innocent the villagers would send a portion of their harvested grains and vegetables to the landlord's house the landlord never paid them wies because all the land belonged to him one day the landlord was talking to his clerk have you seen clerk how the villagers still honor me for the generosity my aners showed yes sir you are indeed very fortunate to have such respect it's like you were born with a silver spoon indeed all the people in this Village are our subjects this is their tradition just then villager named Malaya arrived sir we went hunting and caught a wild Bo that you would like I brought it for you Malia why did you bring it here instead of taking it home tell me the truth our landlord eats then we eat our landlord loves me so I brought it directly here the villagers took turns hunting and bringing the game to the landlord it became an unbreakable rule anyone who broke it would face Civ s punishment every day someone had to bring a share of meat to the landlord at one end of the village lived a man named chodu who had no one and survived by raising chickens and Ducks one day it was his turn to bring meat to the landlord he went to the forest for hunting clerk who turn is it today to go hunting today it's Chino St sir that poor guy lives alone will he even manage to hunt the rules you set must be followed by everyone said that day chodo was lucky enough to catch a wild goat in the forest he struggled a lot for it but didn't want to take it to the landlord he sat under a tree and thought I walked so hard to catch this SC why should I give it to the landlord this is unfair I need to find a way to change this custom while thinking an idea struck him he stayed in the forest the whole day roasted and ate the goat and slept peacefully the landlord didn't receive any meet the day where is the Hunter he hasn't return yet what happened bring the whip I will teach him a lesson today the landlord in anger ordered the whip to be brought and waited to punish shodu sir I suspect a wild animal might have eaten chinu otherwise he would have written by now as they were talking they saw chinu returning with the goat's Kass on his shoulder the landlord's anger subsided when he saw chodu had brought so much meat chodu put the goat's carcass before the landlord and stood humbly feeling pity the landlord asked what happened Shu why didn't you come yesterday did the forest trouble you chinu shaking his head replied no sir there is a bigger story behind this first I caught a rabbit and stopped under a tree suddenly the rabbit jumped onto the tree and I saw a bright light and a woman in the light I got scared and ran back into the forest to hunt this goat for you hearing this both the landlord and the clerk were astonished the goddess said you are our protector and we should serve you diligently she want me to bring a significant offering and not a m rabbit that's why I brought this goat for you chodo told a fabricated story and the landlord was very pleased with him for bringing the goddess's message oh chinu you brought the goddess's message I am very happy today cler spread the word about the goddess's message throughout the village the news spread and The Villages started giving more offerings to the landlord out of fear of the Goddess chodu became highly respected among the villagers the landlord was so impressed that he stopped chodu from going back to his Hut and kept him in his service one day the landlord asked chodu chodu how can we repay the goddesses for her blessings sir I'm not worthy of advising you but you should offer fine roosters to the goddess as gratitude why should the goddess stay in the forest can't she come to our home I have a suspicion stop it cler you are envious of my fortune give chinu two fine roosters and send him away if you doubt him again I will offer you to the goddess don't say that sir I just had a small doubt I won't question the goddess or chin again the next day chinu took two roosters to the forest roasted and ate them and returned the following day chinu did the goddess say anything the landl Lord asked eagerly the goddess is pleased with your devotion and asked us to build a temple for her s said the money should come from you not the villagers the landlord believed chodu words the God's blessings are on us I will do anything for her let's build the temple the landlord funded the construction of a grand Temple believing it would bring blessings the villagers revered the goddess even more the landlord pleased with chodu honored him greatly finally the goddess's temple is complete I'm very happy thanks to you chinu sir I just conveyed the goddess's words you fulfilled her wishes with devotion I'm just a messenger indeed my income has also increased if you hadn't told me the goddess's words this wouldn't have been possible all credit goes to you the landlord praised chodu immensely that year however a severe drought struck the reion crops failed and people stabbed the landlord has holded a lot of grain but even he feared the famine clerk lock The Granary securely the fem is revising the country people are are starving we need to be cautious sir if we keep the grain while people starve what good is it if we distribute it people will see you as a savior stop advising me do as I say the clerk reluctantly locked the grand reies one morning chodu looking dis shelved and limping came to the landlord what happened youu why do you look like this sir godess say spoke to me again today really what did she say she said not a single person should die of hunger in this Village the landlord asked what should we do then chinu replied distribute all the food we have to the people immediately the landlord was stunned slowly he said how can I give away all the grain I worked hard to store what will I have left but if I don't do it what will be left that's what I said the goddesses will be angry if you don't obey the village will be reduced to ashes and no one will survive really even the grand R might burn take these Keys chinu distribute the grain to everyone people must survive as chodu tried to speak again the landlord interrupted you don't need to say anything more just do what I say the villagers survived the famine thanks to Chino's cleverness the landlord continued to instill fear of goddess to maintain order and The Villages diligently followed the Traditions the landlord gained more profit and was seen as a good ruler chinu with his intelligence brought change and selflessly served the village [Music] [Music]
