**Summary:** In the village of Nalim, the landlord and villagers had a long-standing tradition where villagers gifted game to the landlord. Chodu, a lone man, decided to challenge this custom after catching a goat. He invented a story about a goddess asking for a larger offering, which the landlord believed. Chodu used his influence to convince the villagers to offer more to the landlord and the landlord built a temple for the goddess. However, a drought struck and the landlord refused to distribute grain. Chodu used his connection to the "goddess" to force the landlord to provide relief. Chodu's cleverness brought about change in Nalim. The landlord became a more benevolent ruler, fearing the wrath of the goddess. The villagers respected both the landlord and Chodu, who continued to serve the village selflessly.
